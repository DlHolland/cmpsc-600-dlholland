Introducing Codonify
Codonify is an extensible packaging system for python libraries with a specific aim toward static code analysis (security and linting).


Running Codonify
Clone the repository, navigate to the monofile within the src directory, and run the following command:

./monofile.py

This will run all the various python libraries through the Codon compiler on the Bandit source code to show its effectiveness!
